** Utilities

This directory is intended to hold files for use in *any* iOS application.
Classes here can depend on one another, but there should be no dependencies on
anything not in iOS. /Please/ do not put any code in here that refers to a
class, method, comment, or even a name that makes sense only in the context of
a particular app.
