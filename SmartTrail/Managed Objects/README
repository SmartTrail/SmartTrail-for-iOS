** Managed Objects

These files were created automatically by the Xcode data modeling tool.
When you use the tool to make modifications to your data model, it is simple to
have it create NSManagedObject subclass files for you. This speed and
convenience makes a lot of sense, and not just in the early stages of developing
an app.

So /please/ do not check in any manual changes to these files. If you think you
need to do so, try rethinking your app's object model. These classes just define
data objects -- basically just smart data structures. Their job is to hold data.
Adding state or behavior is likely to violate the separation of concerns.

If you do need to associate particular behavior with one of these
NSManagedObject subclasses, consider creating a catagory of the subclass. In
that case, this directory is the best place for the catagory's .h file, and
you can edit it as needed, of course.
