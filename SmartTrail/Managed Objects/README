** Managed Objects

These files were created automatically by the Xcode data modeling tool.
When you use the tool to make modifications to your data model, it is simple to
have it create NSManagedObject subclass files for you. This speed and
convenience makes a lot of sense, and not just in the early stages of developing
an app.

So /please/ do not check in any manual changes to these files. If you think you
need to do so, try rethinking your app's object model. These classes just define
data objects -- basically just smart data structures. Their job is to hold data.
Adding state or behavior is likely to violate the separation of concerns.
